*** Philosophy ***

* Object oriented style
* Files should have a single purpose clearly stated at the top of the file.
* This purpose should be simple enough to explain in one line.
* Object behavior should depend only on game state and it's memory.
* Comment liberally.

*** General Tips ***

* List local variables at the top of each function.
* Variables use snakecase and function names camelcase.
* Object types are capitalized. 
* No repeating blocks of code.
* No line over 80 characters.
* Semicolon after each }.
* Single quotes only.
* Tab is two spaces.
* Creep names should never be specified.

*** Comments ***

* Comment with //.
* Comment before every object and function.
* Comment inside every loop.
